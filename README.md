# SomethingDigital_EnterpriseIndexPerf

This improves Magento EE's indexer performance, most notably for
`catalog_category_product`.  Stores with large catalogs are most affected.

The functionality of the index is not altered.


## Requirements

 * PHP 5.4.0 or higher
 * Magento EE 1.13.1.0 through Magento EE 1.14.3.1

Note: The most major improvement here has been integrated into Magento 2.
